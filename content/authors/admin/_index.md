I am interested in the atmospheric pathways of microplastics, especially the suspension of microplastic particles. At the moment I am working on windtunnel experiments to gain insight about the physical conditions needed for suspension of microplastics in nature. 

When I am not at the university I suspend some frisbees into the air.
